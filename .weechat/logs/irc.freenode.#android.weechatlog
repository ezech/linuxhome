2020-01-01 23:30:59	EdgyMC_69	Hi. I haven't had an android phone in years. Would the pixels be visible on a 6 inch phone with (~1440)x720px res display? I wanted to read on it and watch videos.

2020-01-01 23:32:05	ezech	EdgyMC_69: I think for videos it doesn't matter at all, and for reading pixel densiti is less important than visibility
2020-01-01 23:32:54	EdgyMC_69	Visibility as in contrast or lightness?
2020-01-01 23:33:12	EdgyMC_69	Or do you mean in-app visibility?
2020-01-01 23:33:22	ezech	I've read quite a few books printed on shitty quality moldy paper, with poor quality print as well
2020-01-01 23:33:45	ezech	720p would be a huge upgrade over those paper books
2020-01-01 23:34:07	ezech	visibility as in all factors combined, so if you read in a bus even how well screen reflects light from windows
2020-01-01 23:34:31	EdgyMC_69	I remember reading a lot on a 480px phone but the display was smaller. I think I'll at least compare the pixel densities.
2020-01-01 23:34:49	ezech	screen size would make a difference 
2020-01-01 23:35:10	EdgyMC_69	I'm on the fence with the Moto G7 Power. I really like the 5000mAh battery but the resolution compared to the screen size sounds scary.
2020-01-01 23:35:46	ezech	it's easy to measure Ah, hard to measure what it means

2020-01-01 23:36:29	EdgyMC_69	hm... some users on a forum said that they used it for 2 days and they still had half of the battery
2020-01-01 23:36:35	ezech	if 5Ah in your Moto G7 means 28h of service it's less than 3Ah of some other if it means 32h of service
2020-01-01 23:37:24	EdgyMC_69	some reviewers said that it's 14.5h of watching youtube using wifi with the display on full brightness
2020-01-01 23:37:42	ezech	I'd say this is overkill then
2020-01-01 23:37:55	ezech	unless it can double as a powerbank
2020-01-01 23:38:21	EdgyMC_69	I don't think so, I think it's a low range device.
2020-01-01 23:38:43	ezech	if it could charge your cordless headset and watch, then it would be interesting
2020-01-01 23:39:07	ezech	half of your flight you watch youtube, other half you're asleep charging your other devices
2020-01-01 23:39:46	ezech	I'm not a huge fan of low end devices, half the price, twice as many problems
2020-01-01 23:40:32	ezech	harder to find quality accesories, harder to service if you need to

2020-01-01 23:41:56	EdgyMC_69	well yeah, I get that with a premium device you get a premium service but I don't like buying... things

2020-01-01 23:43:17	Khaytsus	I'd rather charge my phone daily and it not be shit.

2020-01-01 23:45:29	ezech	EdgyMC_69: maybe search for something premium-ish
2020-01-01 23:46:25	ezech	I went for xperia Z5 compact, kind of premium insides but significantly lower price
2020-01-01 23:46:35	EdgyMC_69	Are there premiumish things for $180 with tax?
2020-01-01 23:47:58	ezech	EdgyMC_69: that's kind of low for anything these days
