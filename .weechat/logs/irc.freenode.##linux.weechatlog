So, you can try to use regular expressions on HTML, but it may not work.  In particular, if you have nested things, regular expressions cannot be guaranteed to extract them correctly.

2020-01-01 21:35:45	ryouma	you don't need a separate var dir pr....obably?  maybe you do if you are running a server.

2020-01-01 21:36:03	Dagmar	konrados: Either way you have to do what they're saying with apparmor becuase it operates on the _real_ locations of files
2020-01-01 21:36:09	konrados	Dagmar, well, if I'll have to fight again with this, then .... I'm just tired :( You said I'll get rid of all the issues if I'll simply mount it :(

2020-01-01 21:36:19	c705	konrados: if you decide to move mysql's default directory, you will likely have to configure app armor

2020-01-01 21:36:47	Dagmar	konrados: If, on the other hand, you simply made a separate filesystem for mysql's data files and didn't involve a freakin symlink, you would have no conflict with apparmor

2020-01-01 21:38:02	konrados	Dagmar - ok, I dropped the idea of symlinks, but will I have (other) issues when I'll make a separate filesystems?
2020-01-01 21:38:16	konrados	I didn't know it's so complicated :(
2020-01-01 21:38:55	konrados	If I knew, I would just ... install the whole thing on the new device, but apparently it's not easy either .....
2020-01-01 21:39:44	ryouma	if you are going to be a sysadmin, then do as dagmar says but if not, this is all normal (unless you are using zfs).  even in windows it would be normal i imagine.

2020-01-01 22:41:14	kerframil	yeah, though - to be fair - that's a fairly recent feature. it is generally true of filesystems that they store just bytes and leave it up to userspace to decide what to make of it.
2020-01-01 22:41:18	Dagmar	This meant that when a filename with something like "&" in it happened _rsync would break_

2020-01-01 22:42:36	geirha	passing a list of filenames is really cumbersome when writing portable scripts, because posix utilities don't have the ability to handle NUL delimited data, so you have to work around it with all kinds of ugly hacks
2020-01-01 22:42:36	ryouma	why do you need those filenames?
2020-01-01 22:42:45	Dagmar	So I rewrote the thing and I tested it by writing a little perl script that generated a few thousand completly random filenames (minus null and /) and then replicated it
